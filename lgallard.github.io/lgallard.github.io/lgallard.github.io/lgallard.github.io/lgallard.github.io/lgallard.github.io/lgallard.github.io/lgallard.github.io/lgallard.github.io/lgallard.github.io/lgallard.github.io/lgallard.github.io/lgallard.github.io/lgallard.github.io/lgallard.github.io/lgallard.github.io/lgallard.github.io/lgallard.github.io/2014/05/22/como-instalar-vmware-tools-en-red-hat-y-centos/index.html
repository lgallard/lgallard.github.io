<p><br />
If you need to install VMWare Tools on virtual machines running Red Hat or CentOS as operating system, you can follow the procedure described next:</p>

<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>

<p>First of in VMWare vSphere locate the virtual machine you want to install the VMWare Tools and click on “<em>Install VMWare Tools”</em> as shown in the next image:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>You will see a dialog window indicating that the VMWare Tools will be mounted by clicking on the “mount” button. Then in the virtual machine where you want to install the VMWare Tools you must do the following in the terminal:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/
mount: block device /dev/sr0 is write-protected, mounting read-only

# cp /mnt/VMwareTools-9.0.0-782409.tar.gz /opt/

# cd /opt/
# tar xvzf VMwareTools-9.0.0-782409.tar.gz

# cd vmware-tools-distrib/

#./vmware-install.pl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The latter is a script which will ask you questions related to the VMWare Tools intallation. In genersl terms the default option are okay, but if you want to modify any parameter you can change any value according to your needs:</p>

software that is integrated with vSphere to create backups of the virtual
machine. Do you wish to enable this feature? [no]

Found a compatible pre-built module for vsock. Installing it...

The module vmxnet3 has already been installed on this system by another
installer or package and will not be modified by this installer. Use the flag
--clobber-kernel-modules=vmxnet3 to override.

The module pvscsi has already been installed on this system by another
installer or package and will not be modified by this installer. Use the flag
--clobber-kernel-modules=pvscsi to override.

Creating a new initrd boot image for the kernel.
vmware-tools start/running
The configuration of VMware Tools 9.0.0 build-782409 for Linux for this running
kernel completed successfully.

You must restart your X session before any mouse or graphics changes take
effect.

You can now run VMware Tools by invoking "/usr/bin/vmware-toolbox-cmd" from the
command line.

To enable advanced X features (e.g., guest resolution fit, drag and drop, and
file and text copy/paste), you will need to do one (or more) of the following:
1. Manually start /usr/bin/vmware-user
2. Log out and log back into your desktop session; and,
3. Restart your X session.

Enjoy,

No eject (or equivilant) command could be located.
Eject Failed: If possible manually eject the Tools installer from the guest
cdrom mounted at /mnt before canceling tools install on the host.

<p>When the script had finished the VMWare Tools will be installed on the virtual machine. Now you can umount the ISO by doing:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># umount /mnt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then in VSphere you can check that VMWare Tools are running as shown in the first picture of this article.</p>
